            <h2>Behind Hyer</h2>
            <p> Hyer® Aviation was founded in 2020. Usually taken for granted in this sector, some services are not delivered at the same level as they should be. Hyer® was built to tackle this problem. Hyer has a motivated team that ensures every flight experience runs smoothly. </p>

            <P>I have been flying with Hyer as an ELEVATE member for a while now, after being an unsatisfied&nbsp; Netjets customer. The Hyer team always amazes me with their service. They really go the extra mile. I would like to recommend Hyer to any private flier.</P>

            <h4>Our timeline</h4>
            <h5>2021</h5>
            <p> 
                The company expanded its services to Germany,
                Austria and Switzerland. Clients outside the initial closed 
                group were welcomed to book with ENVOY. 
                The company introduced the innovative Smart Quotes, 
                simplifying the process of choosing an aircraft. 
                Shortly after, the client base expanded to the 
                United Kingdom and Spain.</p>
             <h5>2022</h5>
             <p>
                First-of-its-kind Shared Flights were introduced. Repatriation flights were organised in Asia, Africa and Europe with both small and large aircraft. Special solutions for groups and a carbon offset program for private aviation in Benelux were launched. 
             </p>  
             <h5>2023</h5>
             <p>
                ENVOY rebranded to Hyer® Aviation. A new brand, website and a tech-driven strategy were launched, followed by a bold service portfolio. An innovative proprietary platform and an ambitious membership program were released to support better the rapid demand for Hyer® services and exclusive flights.
             </p>   
             <h5>2024</h5>
             <p>
                Hyer developed a client portfolio and launched an exclusive mobile application for its loyal clients. A significant increase in demand, primarily during summer, has led to additional sales teams and flight support.
